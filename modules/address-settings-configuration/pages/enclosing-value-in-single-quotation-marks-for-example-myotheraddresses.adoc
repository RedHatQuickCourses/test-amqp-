= Enclosing `match` Property Values in Single Quotation Marks

When configuring address settings for AMQ Broker on OpenShift, the `match` property within an `addressSetting` block plays a crucial role in defining which addresses or address patterns a particular configuration applies to. It allows you to specify a literal address name or a pattern using wildcard characters.

== The `match` Property and Wildcard Expressions

The `match` property is used to define the address or pattern for which the `addressSetting` configuration is applied. While simple literal address names do not require special enclosing, using *wildcard expressions* necessitates enclosing the `match` property's value in single quotation marks.

This is particularly important when you want to apply a configuration to a group of addresses rather than a single, specific one.

=== Understanding Wildcard Characters

AMQ Broker supports the following wildcard characters in address patterns:

*   `#`: The hash character matches *any* address that starts with the preceding string, regardless of how many words follow. For example, `europe-news.#` matches `europe-news`, `europe-news.politics`, and `europe-news.politics.fr`.
*   `*`: The asterisk character matches a *single word* and can be used anywhere within the address string. For example, `usa-news.*` matches `usa-news.domestic` and `usa-news.intl`, but not `usa-news.domestic.politics`.

When you incorporate these wildcard characters into your `match` property value, you *must* enclose the entire value in single quotation marks. This ensures that the Kubernetes Operator correctly interprets the pattern and does not misinterpret the special characters.

[NOTE]
In `brokerProperties` entries, a period (`.`) is a reserved character. If you want to create an address pattern that contains a period and a wildcard, you must enclose the address in quotation marks. For example, `"usa-news.*"`. However, for `ActiveMQArtemisAddress` CR or `addressSettings` within `ActiveMQArtemis` CR, single quotes around the entire `match` value containing a wildcard are the standard.

=== Example: Configuring Address Settings for a Wildcard Pattern

Let's consider an example where you want to apply specific address settings, such as a dead letter address and maximum delivery attempts, to any address that starts with `myOtherAddresses`.

In this scenario, you would use the hash wildcard character (`#`) to match the pattern `myOtherAddresses#`, and you would enclose this pattern in single quotation marks as `'myOtherAddresses#'`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: my-broker-instance
spec:
  # ... other broker configurations ...
  addressSettings:
    applyRule: merge_all # <1>
    addressSetting:
    - match: myAddress
      deadLetterAddress: myDeadLetterAddress
      maxDeliveryAttempts: 5
    - match: 'myOtherAddresses#' # <2>
      deadLetterAddress: myDeadLetterAddressForOthers
      maxDeliveryAttempts: 3
----
<1> The `applyRule` property specifies how the Operator applies the configuration (e.g., `merge_all`).
<2> The `match` property uses a wildcard expression `'myOtherAddresses#'` to apply the settings to all addresses starting with `myOtherAddresses`. The single quotes are crucial here.

In this example:

*   The first `addressSetting` block applies specific rules to the literal address `myAddress`.
*   The second `addressSetting` block applies a different set of rules (e.g., `maxDeliveryAttempts: 3`) to *any* address that starts with `myOtherAddresses`, such as `myOtherAddresses.queue1`, `myOtherAddresses.topic.sub1`, etc. The single quotes around `'myOtherAddresses#'` are essential for the Operator to correctly interpret this wildcard pattern.

By correctly enclosing wildcard expressions in single quotation marks, you ensure that your AMQ Broker address settings are applied as intended, providing flexible and robust message routing and delivery management.
