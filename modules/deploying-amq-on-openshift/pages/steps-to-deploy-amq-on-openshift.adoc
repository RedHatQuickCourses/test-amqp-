#  Steps to deploy AMQ on OpenShift

== Deploying AMQ on OpenShift

Deploying Red Hat AMQ on OpenShift involves several steps to ensure a successful installation and configuration. This section will guide you through the process, providing detailed instructions and considerations for each step.

### Prerequisites for Deployment

Before deploying AMQ on OpenShift, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **OpenShift Cluster**: A running OpenShift cluster (either self-managed or OpenShift Online/Dedicated).
2. **oc CLI**: The OpenShift Command Line Interface (oc) installed and configured to interact with your OpenShift cluster.
3. **Red Hat AMQ Operator**: The Red Hat AMQ Operator available in your OpenShift cluster's catalog.
4. **Project**: An OpenShift project (namespace) where you will deploy AMQ resources.

### Steps to Deploy AMQ on OpenShift

1. **Create a Project**: Create a new project (namespace) for AMQ resources using the following command:

   ```
   oc new-project amq-project
   ```

2. **Add Red Hat AMQ Operator**: Add the Red Hat AMQ Operator to your OpenShift cluster by creating the necessary Operator Group and Subscription resources. Use the following YAML manifests as a reference:

   - Operator Group: `amq-operator-group.yaml`

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
     kind: OperatorGroup
     metadata:
       name: amq-operator-group
       namespace: amq-project
     spec:
       targetNamespaces:
         - amq-project
     ```

   - Subscription: `amq-subscription.yaml`

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
     kind: Subscription
     metadata:
       name: amq-subscription
       namespace: amq-project
     spec:
       name: amq-operator
       channel: stable
       installPlanApproval: Automatic
       source: redhat-operators
       sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
     ```

   Apply the manifests using the `oc apply -f` command:

   ```
   oc apply -f amq-operator-group.yaml
   oc apply -f amq-subscription.yaml
   ```

3. **Create AMQ Broker**: Create an AMQ Broker instance using the following YAML manifest:

   - Broker: `amq-broker.yaml`

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v
